            <h2>Government Support Programs for Farmers</h2>
            <p>
                Farmers play a crucial role in our society, providing us with essential food and resources.
                To support their efforts, various government subsidy programs are available. These subsidies
                aim to assist farmers in improving productivity, adopting modern technologies, and mitigating
                risks associated with agriculture.
            </p>

            <h3>Types of Subsidies</h3>
            <p>
                Agricultural subsidies can take different forms, including financial assistance, subsidies
                for seeds and fertilizers, and insurance programs. Governments worldwide recognize the
                importance of sustaining a robust agricultural sector and implement policies to ensure farmers
                receive adequate support.
            </p>

            <h3>Benefits for Farmers</h3>
            <p>
                The benefits of subsidies extend to farmers by reducing production costs, providing financial
                stability, and encouraging the adoption of sustainable farming practices. Additionally, these
                programs contribute to ensuring food security and maintaining a stable agricultural economy.
